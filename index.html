        <ul>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.  HTML handles the structure and content, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, quick and permanent changes but less flexible because inline must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of an HTML file.  The rules only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: the most common way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A class selector is any HTML element assigned to the class will gain the properties from CSS.</li>
