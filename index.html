        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.  HTML handles the structure and content, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, quick and permanent changes but less flexible because inline must be edited individually.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of an HTML file.  The rules only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: the most common way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>A class selector is any HTML element assigned to the class will gain the properties from CSS.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a developer language that adds interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are built into web browsers providing functionality.</li>
          <li>The const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value. It locks down what the variable will be and cannot be reassigned.</li>
          <li>If Statements will check whether a condition evaluates to be true or false. The answer determines the next course of action and application.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array we declare a variable using const and then give the variable a name and assign it to a group of values.</li>
          <li>An array index is a unique number that identifies the location of the data item in the array.</li>
          <li>Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>Two requirements for a JavaScript function: 1 Define the function, 2 Call the function.</li>
          <li>A function's name is always followed by parentheses ().</li>
        </ul>
