# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this project in order to create a study guide for myself and any other bootcamp attendees to utilize before class starts. This will provide everyone with some knowledge before class so we can hit the ground running! Some people may not have any background coding knowledge, and this can all seem like a foreign language, so if there is a place to reference beginning knowledge it will help. I learned a lot of basic coding skills making this study guide so it has helped me tremendously!

## Usage

This study guide will assist bootcamp attendees in preparing for the first day of class. There are four sections that contain notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. The notes will provide background information on the topics that will help prepare students for class. If the DevTools is opened by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), the student can see the JavaScript running in a console panel that opens. There will be a list of topics from the prework and a suggestion of which topic to study first.
